            <h2>About Me<br>__<br></h2>
            <!-- The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. He to whom the emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand wrapped in awe, is as good as dead; his eyes are closed. -->

            <p> I like to think of myself as an avid learner above all else. The two quotes above seem to encapsulate this disposition best, as even just overhearing a tidbit in passing can lead me down a rabbit-hole of readings from 20 parallel tabs, and bear fruit as a budding obsession. <br> I'm fascinated and utterly captivated by topics such as: the mechanisms underlying memory and consciousness, the root impulses behind <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-018-0147-8">how humans decide to act</a>, emergent phenomena of microstates on the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.082065899">quantum level</a> to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.3256.pdf">societal level</a>, the way our intangible minds interface our flesh with this world and derive physicality when everything at the quantum level is ultimately a wave, and on and on. Through the use of computation and Machine Learning, I hope to be able to pursue these questions, as well as any and all I have and that may come up with in the future. </p>
            <p>Outside of my academics, I enjoy staying active through swimming, running, and biking (though I wouldn't consider it triathlon training just yet) as well as bouldering. I also greatly enjoy baking-- sourdough breads especially-- and cooking in general, and maintain (to the best of my ability) this <a href="portfolio/portfolioHome.html">photography portfolio</a>. Oh, and in my copious free time, I do very much enjoy ruminating over various ontological and epistemological questions as well :) </p>
