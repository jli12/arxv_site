Unlike most spiders, jumping spiders are actually able to recognize objects/people since they are active hunters; since most spiders are relatively static hunters, they instead see people as a part of the ever changing landscape. Plus, it helps that jumping spiders are indeed quite cute"],

I was wondering how herbivores/livestock are able to get their requisite nutrients just from eating plants. With regards to ruminant animals, they are able to derive the nutrients they need through their multiple stomachs. When they first fill up on grass, it is chewed very little and immediately goes into their rumen, where various enzymes digest it a bit. It (referred to as the “cud”) then gets regurgitated and chewed again to further the mechanical breakdown. After the second chewing, the cud goes back into the rumen where the microbes present will further break down the insoluble fibers/cellulose (undigestible for non-ruminants) through various fermentation processes. From there, everything (including the microbes) continues to the abomasum, whose high pH kills the microbes from which the ruminants are finally able to extract all their requisite nutrients. So ruminants essentially eat their food (grass) to produce their real food (microbes) which is quite humorous.",

				"08122021": ["One of the major paleontological mysteries of the upper Cretaceous Period is the relative lack of middle-sized carnivorous dinosaurs. Recent fossil findings have uncovered T-rex-like fossils; however, they are much smaller than the traditional T-rex fossils previously found. Coupled with further analysis, researchers have proposed that the T-rex had actually evolved to dominate multiple niches as a function of its age (similar to the komodo dragon today), with the juvenile T-rexs’ increased nimbleness/speed allowing them to hunt the smaller more nimble herbivores, while the adult T-rexs with their exponentially greater jaw strength allowed them to dispatch the much larger herbivores.\n",

This suggests that such animals have more effective methods of cancer resistance/suppression, which should be further studied for potential human medical uses. ",

It’s due to a type of ion channel called TRPC5, which is depolarized when cooled.

				"08162021": ["I've known that neutrinos oscillate, which can be observed as they stream towards Earth from the CMB. However, I only just learned that they don't just simply live in a static superposition (e.g. 1/3 electron, 1/3 muon, 1/3 tau) of flavors; they also live in a flux of mass eigenstates, which changes as they travel. So, while a neutrino may be 1/3 electron,muon,tau at one point, it could be 2/3 electron and 1/6 muon or tau at another. "],
				"08192021": ["Ever wondered why rubbing one's eyes feels so gosh darn good? When one rubs their eyes, there are pressure sensors that stimulates the lacrimal and meibomian glands and increases moisture on the eyes. However, that pressure also triggers the oculocardiac reflex, stimulating the trigeminal and vagus nerves whose downstream effects cause one's heartrate to decrease by up to 20%-- and account for the \"calming\" effect one feels as a result."],

I somehow just discovered he did a podcast with Lex Fridman, and I'm not even 30min in and have been ruminating over a few things: \n\t1.) could human intelligence (and maybe even consiousness as we know it) be an emergent phenomenon of humans in groups?\n\t\tI mean obviously without other humans one single human wouldn't be very smart. But would said person also have or be aware of their inner monologue?\n\t2.) Nothing all too profound, but just a cool statement: that the mind is the obviator of the world, and that it both creates the experience, but also experiences (is consious and feels) about that experience as well. So everything we know as a part of life is just our very own illusion/hallucenation. \nCan't wait to keep listening!"],
				"08212021": ["Ever wonder what our kneecaps (aka patellas) are there for? The common misconceptions are protection or stability, but their most impactful contribution to our physiology is actually more of a mechanical one. First, it's also important to know that it's a sesamoid-bone, meaning it actually develops/grows from inside of a tendon (the patella tendon in this case). With the patella being located at the top of our tibia and connected to our femur, it increases the leverge that the tendon has over the tibia, allowing for up to 30% increases in contractile strength, allowing us to run, jump, kick, etc. faster/stronger.
